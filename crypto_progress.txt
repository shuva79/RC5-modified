15th Dec, 2023: Restarted doing the crypto algo cause old one just stopped working for some reason

16th Dec, 2023:
- Encryption/decryption process done for now still needs some refining
- Beautified code and added a few comments to make sense of everything


21th Dec, 2023:
- Getting closer to modification
- Flipping bits is a little hard but I've made a function to do it

23rd Dec, 2023:
- Word modification might be a bitch and a half, I'll do this if I have the time
- Creating an array of factors, was unsurprisingly, a bitch and a half as well.
  So what I had to do was allocate memory for the array cause dynamic arrays dont exist in c
  I had to then find out a way to update these values. Now, I have to worry about the function
  and then the positions thingy. I'll figure it out till tomorrow morning.
- The function I came up with is 3*x^2 + 5 * root(x). Root x will give float so I'll multiply it by 10 and floor it.

25th Dec, 2023:
- Find out how to convert int value into hex to convert that into a string.

28th Dec, 2023:
- Fixed a few things, converting the modified ciphertext from char to unsigned int(used for hex)
- Encryption process is finally done
- For decryption, first pass the value through the whole modification part and then decrypt. Otherwise, shits gon come out janky as hell
- Everything looks good, now focus on the flowchart and algorithm.
- For algorithm, show the entire 24 round process (I have already automated the whole thing just copy paste) 
- Make two flowcharts, one showing RC5 encryption and the other showing modification.
